## Binary Search

**Notebook**: `binary_search.ipynb`

This notebook covers the binary search algorithm, which is used to efficiently find a target value within a sorted array. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

## Binary Trees

**Notebook**: `binary_trees.ipynb`

This notebook provides an introduction to binary trees, a fundamental data structure where each node has at most two children. It covers tree traversal techniques and operations such as insertion and deletion.

## Dictionaries and Counting Sort

**Notebook**: `dictionaries_and_counting_sorting.ipynb`

This notebook explores the use of dictionaries (hash maps) and the counting sort algorithm. Counting sort is a non-comparison based sorting algorithm that sorts integers by counting occurrences.

## Linear Search

**Notebook**: `linear_search.ipynb`

This notebook covers the linear search algorithm, a straightforward method for finding a target value within an array. It checks each element of the array sequentially until the target value is found.

## Multiplicity

**Notebook**: `multiplicity.ipynb`

This notebook deals with problems related to multiplicity, such as finding the multiplicity of a number in a sequence. It includes various approaches and optimizations.

## Prefix Sums and Two Pointers

**Notebook**: `prefix_sums_and_two_pointers.ipynb`

This notebook introduces prefix sums and the two pointers technique, both of which are useful for solving a variety of array-related problems efficiently.

## Sorting Events

**Notebook**: `sorting_events.ipynb`

This notebook explores algorithms for sorting events based on various criteria. It covers different sorting techniques and their applications in event management scenarios.

Happy coding!
